                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A WAY TO BUY – A WAY TO SELL – The auction method has been around almost as long as man started to walk the earth. Whether one wants to sell the home which they raised their family in,
				   sell the family farm or business they made their living with, you can bet you will always have a buyer waiting for you to sell. Our auction business started in 1980, I had never 
				   imagined back then while advertising in one of the available media’s just how advanced we would see modern media become the dominating factor to attract buyers from all around the 
				   world. There are buyers for anything and everything, how would they ever know it was for sale unless you the seller were to employ the Auctioneer, the Auctioneer by advertising with
				   a single touch of the button can reach millions of buyers for your property, be it real estate, personal property, antiques and even fine arts there is no better way to expose it to 
				   the world than by the auction method with modern technology today.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We can sell on site; (live auctions and live auctions with streaming), Timed online auctions; ( timed online auctions allow the buyer days to make their bids) for any property the 
				   seller wants to liquidate. The most remarks I receive hours, days and weeks after a live auction is; I WISH I WOULD HAVE BID MORE TIMES… With the online timed auctions one can be in
				   the privacy of their office or home and bid on any type of property up for auction up to the day it expires. Seller’s keep this in mind when deciding who you want to hire as your
				   auction company as our method can yield you more bidders and higher prices.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With any of the aforementioned types of auction methods and our years of experience, we aim to bring each and every seller market prices or better.</p>
