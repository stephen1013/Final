			<h2>How to Buy</h2>

			<details>
               <summary><strong>BUYING AT AUCTION</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A real estate auction is an innovative and effective method of buying real estate; there are many benefits and unique opportunities available when buying 
				   real estate at auction. It is an intense, accelerated real estate marketing process that involves the public sale of any property—including those that are nondistressed—through open 
				   cry as well as online bidding which we offer as Timed Bidding which last a number of days, bidders go through a pre-registration process, once approved they can bid from their 
				   home/office or mobil device. </p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our staff is there to do all we can to make the process a positive experience. One advantage is knowing the seller is fully committed to selling, therefore eliminating long 
				   negotiation periods and reducing the time involved in purchasing the property. Buyers are able to determine the sales price and purchased at fair market value through competitive 
				   bidding.</p>
            </details>
			
			<details>
               <summary><strong>PRIOR TO AUCTION</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The primary difference between buying real estate at auction verses buying real estate conventionally is that at auction, you do all inspections and
				   prepare your financing prior to coming to the auction. A real estate auction is a sale of property in as-is condition with no contingencies so preparation in advance is important to
				   allow the buyer to bid with confidence. Buyers are responsible for making all inspections and evaluating the property for their protection.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the days leading up to the auction you will want to find answers to your questions regarding the property, know what the auction process is and when payment is due. You can view 
				the property at our open house dates, which are posted on our website or call for private showing. Please feel free to review our Real Estate Terms & Conditions or call our office for 
				assistance if you have any questions.</p>
            </details>
			
			<details>
               <summary><strong>DAY OF LIVE AUCTION OR ONLINE AUCTION</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will need to register for a bid number and review the bid packet for the terms and conditions of the auction. A live auction will begin promptly so 
				   arrive in plenty of time to make final inspections as well as pre-auction announcements (terms, conditions and any last minute changes to the auction) The bidding is fast paced so be
				   prepared. In order to make a bid you will need to get the attention of the auctioneer by raising your bid number or waving your hand or simply by saying yes. If you are unsure if 
				   your bid is the high bid, do not hesitate to ask one of the bid assistants or the auctioneer to confirm this. </p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The auctioneer wants to provide every opportunity for you to place your bid and will not let you bid against yourself. The online bidding process will not be as fast paced until the 
				   last few minutes of the auction coming to the end, every bidder must pay close attention making every second count if they are wanting to be the winning bid.</p>  
            </details>
			
			<details>
               <summary><strong>THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDER</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At a live real estate auction, once the bidding stops the Auctioneer will confirm the sale and recognize the high bidder. Reserved auctions are subject to
   				   seller’s approval of the bid attained and a minimum bid auction will start at a reflected price and expected to rise in increments until an acceptable bid is approved. The high bidder
				   when approved or when the Auctioneer says SOLD will then complete the Purchase Agreement and sign any additional forms and make the required Earnest Money Deposit.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This payment can be in the form of personal or business check, only at closing must the buyer bring certified funds. Closing of the property will take place in 30-45 days from the day
   				   of the auction. Generally, property is conveyed free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and closing is not contingent financing, appraisals or inspections. Payment of online 
				   auction funds is within the terms when registering.</p>   
            </details>
			
			<details>
               <summary><strong>PAYMENT & CHECKOUT</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Payment is due in full on auction day. Terms are cash, check or credit card. We accept Master Card, Visa & Discover. Once the Auctioneer says SOLD, 
				   the item(s) is your responsibility to secure. The auction company or the seller are not responsible for loss/theft or damage of your items purchased If you need help with removing 
				   the item, we can recommend local movers to assist you if needed.</p>
