               <summary><strong>1. Disputes caused by late delivery of houses</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The seller has not paid the house at the contracted delivery time. In addition to some legitimate reasons, such as the buyer not paying on time, otherwise 
				   the buyer will be liable for breach of contract. At this time, the buyer can request the delivery of the house and compensate for the loss. The loss can be calculated with reference 
				   to the rent of similar houses.</p>				
            </details>

               <summary><strong>2. Disputes arising from overdue registration procedures</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both the seller and the buyer may want to break the contract and do not go through the transfer procedures, but the buyer mainly wants to break the 
				   contract by not paying the house payment, and the seller generally does not go through the transfer procedure. When the seller does not go through the transfer formalities, the buyer 
				   must sue as soon as possible for this house. At the same time, in order to prevent the seller from reselling the house to others, it is best to preserve the house.</p>

               <summary><strong>3. Disputes caused by the request to return the deposit</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to the nature of the deposit, it can be divided into a deposit, a breach of the deposit, etc., which kind of deposit is agreed, the key depends 
				   on how the deposit contract is stipulated. According to the law, a deposit contract should be signed to pay the deposit. If the buyer pays the deposit, only the intermediary company 
				   or seller issues a "receipt" with the word "deposit" written on it, and when the deposit is paid There is no house sale contract or deposit contract, so the nature of this deposit 
				   cannot be determined. In this case, the buyer does not want to buy a house and the deposit should be returned.</p>

               <summary><strong>4. Disputes caused by the cancellation of the house sales contract or confirmation of the invalidity of the house sales contract</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The request to rescind the contract or confirm the contract is invalid usually occurs when the other party has a major breach of contract. Such cases are 
				   usually accompanied by a request for compensation for damages. The court will consider the degree of fault of both parties when hearing such cases. Different, to determine the 
				   responsibilities of each party.</p>
            </details>
			
			<details>
               <summary><strong>5. Disputes caused by "black and white contracts"</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Black and white contract", also known as yin and yang contract, refers to the contract of different prices signed by the buyer and the seller in the 
				   process of buying and selling a second-hand house. The registration sent to the real estate trading center is called "white contract", which is only for registration. The private 
				   contract between the two parties is called "black contract" as the actual transaction price of the transaction. In the event of disputes arising from the different prices of "black 
				   and white contracts", in principle, the contract price in the later period shall prevail. Unless there is evidence to prove that the previous contract price was a false price signed 
				   to avoid tax payment and fraudulent loans.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But pay special attention to that the burden of proof is borne by the objector, that is, whoever thinks the previous contract is false, who should bear 
				   the burden of proof. However, such regulations are not comprehensive, because the time of signing the two contracts does not necessarily have to be sequential, and may be signed at 
				   the same time. If the next contract must prevail, then it will be difficult to determine which contract is the "last contract". So the key is to prove which contract's price meets 
				   the true wishes of both parties</p>

               <summary><strong>6. Disputes caused by relocation of household registration</strong></summary>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the house was delivered, the buyer discovered that the house still had the seller's account or someone else's account. Even if the seller agreed in
   				   the contract that the seller should ensure that the account was removed, the dispute would not be accepted in court. Therefore, such disputes cannot be resolved through legal channels.</p>
